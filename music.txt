Hey Mr. DJ
Put a record on
Music (music) makes the people (makes the people)
Come together, yeah

Don't think of yesterday and I don't look at the clock
I like to boogie-woogie, uh, uh
It's like riding on the wind and it never goes away
But it's everything I'm in, got to have it every day

Music (*all over again*)
DJ, yada-yada
